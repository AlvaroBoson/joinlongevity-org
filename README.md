# Join Longevity Platform

This website is a project itself. We are building the #1 platform for people to understand and get involved in the longevity field. It's open source, and you can contribute.

## Overview

This is the official open-source repository for the [joinlongevity.org](https://joinlongevity.org) website. The site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using the App Router and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Our goal is to create a comprehensive, welcoming, and accurate resource for anyone curious about the science and movement of longevity.
